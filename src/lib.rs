//!
//! FPGRARS was made as an alternative to [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars), as it was
//! too slow for some applications. As such, it implements parsing and simulating RISC-V code,
//! as well as showing images on the screen and interacting with user input.
//!
//! Right now I don't aim to implement the instructions too close to what a real RISC-V processor
//! would execute. For example, there are some pseudoinstructions implemented as real instructions,
//! it's impossible to make self-modifying code and there's no difference between `jal` and `call`.
//! Even then, I think these won't make too much of a difference for most users.
//!
//! Also note that the simulator cares less about correctness than RARS, so some programs that run
//! here will fail there. One such case occurs if you read a word from an unaligned position in memory,
//! FPGRARS doesn't care, but RARS complains.
